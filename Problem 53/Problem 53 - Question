# Problem 53: The High-Stakes Auctioneer

## Problem Description

In a live auction, the "Current Highest Bid" is the only thing that matters. However, if a bidder is disqualified or retracts their bid, the price reverts to the _previous_ highest bid.

### The System Rules

1.  **Bidding**: New bid must be strictly `>` current max.
2.  **Retraction**: The current winner pulls out.
3.  **Reversion**: The state rolls back to exactly what it was before that bid.

## Must Use Data Structures

- **Stack**: Stores `Bid` objects. The Top is always the current Winner.
- (Variables like "CurrentMax" are insufficient because we need the _sequence_ of maxes).

## Operations to Implement (CLI Commands)

- `BID <user> <amount>`
- `WITHDRAW`: Undo last bid.
- `CURRENT`: Show winner.

## Sample Execution

```text
> BID A 100
Current: A (100)
Stack: [100]

> BID B 90
Error: Too low.

> BID C 150
Current: C (150)
Stack: [100, 150]

> WITHDRAW
C retracted.
Reverted to A (100).
Stack: [100]
```

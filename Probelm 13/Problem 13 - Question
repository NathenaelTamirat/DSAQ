Problem 13: Online Exam Submission Platform

Problem Description

Simulate the backend for a coding competition platform (like LeetCode contest mode). Thousands of students submit solutions simultaneously as the deadline approaches.

The System Rules

Submission Flow:
Submissions arrive with timestamp and execution_time_estimate.
Deadline: Any submission after T_DEADLINE is rejected immediately.
Grading Queue:
The system has limited grading servers.
To improve "user satisfaction", Shortest Jobs (low execution estimate) are graded first so more students get results faster.
Fairness Cap:
If a submission has waited > 5 minutes, it ignores the Shortest Job rule and jumps to the front (Starvation prevention).
Must Use Data Structures

Min-Heap: Primary queue for Shortest Job First.
FIFO Queue: For the "Starvation / High Priority" lane.
(Logic: The grader checks the FIFO Queue first, then the Heap).
Operations to Implement (CLI Commands)

SET_DEADLINE <timestamp>
SUBMIT <student> <est_time> <timestamp>
PROCESS: Simulate one grader cycle.
STATUS: Show queues.
Sample Execution

> SET_DEADLINE 100
> SUBMIT S1 500 10 (Long job)
> SUBMIT S2 10 11 (Short job)
> PROCESS
> Grading S2 (Shortest)

> SUBMIT S3 5 101
> Error: Rejected. Past Deadline.
